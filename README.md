# Dave Bennett Website

This is my customized wordpress theme for my Website: <a href="https://www.davebennett.tech/">Dave Bennett.Tech </a>

Based on the Understrap Wordpress theme 
Website: [https://understrap.com](https://understrap.com)

##Building
Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync* (* optional, if you wanna use it) on your computer globally
Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
Run: `$ npm install`

To work and compile your Sass files on the fly start:
`$ gulp watch`

**Note that there are some hard-coded values in header and footer and throughout the template that would need to be removed**
